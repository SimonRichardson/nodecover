nodecover
=========

A lightweight, pure-javascript code coverage tool for nodejs applications. It works out of the box with nodeunit, offering support for more TDD frameworks soon. Generates reports similar to EMMA, in text and html. 

The idea is to add support to customizable reporters as well as custom TDD frameworks.
